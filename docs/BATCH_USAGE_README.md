# 🎮 PRGAVI - Modern Usage Guide

**Note: This guide covers the legacy batch file usage. For the modern approach, use the new GUI and CLI interfaces.**

## 🚀 Modern Usage (Recommended)

```bash
python prgavi_gui.py
```

- Real-time progress tracking
- Mode selection (Standard, 4X Strategy, Beautiful Captions)
- Integrated catalog viewer

### CLI Interface
```bash
# Interactive mode
python prgavi_unified.py --game "Game Name" --steam-url "STEAM_URL"

# Beautiful captions mode
python prgavi_unified.py --game "Game Name" --mode beautiful_captions

# 4X strategy mode

```

## 📋 Requirements
- Windows system (primary support)
- Python 3.8+ installed
- All Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 📝 Examples

### 1. Interactive Mode (Recommended for first-time use)
```batch
createshortswithcontext.bat "https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/"
```
- Automatically fetches game name from Steam
- Downloads assets (screenshots, trailer, metadata)
- Prompts you to enter custom script or use auto-generated
- Creates organized folders and catalog entries

### 2. With Custom Script
```batch
createshortswithcontext.bat "https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/" "No Man's Sky delivers infinite exploration across 18 quintillion unique planets. Build bases, pilot starships, and discover ancient mysteries in this ever-expanding universe. Whether solo or with friends, every journey tells a different story. Available now on Steam!"
```

### 3. PowerShell Usage
```powershell
.\createshortswithcontext.bat "https://store.steampowered.com/app/APP_ID/GAME_NAME/"
```

### 4. CMD Usage
```cmd
createshortswithcontext.bat "https://store.steampowered.com/app/APP_ID/GAME_NAME/"
```

## 🔄 What the Batch File Does

1. **🔗 URL Validation**: Extracts Steam App ID from URL
2. **🎮 Game Info**: Fetches game name via Steam API
3. **📁 Organization**: Creates organized folder structure
4. **📝 Script Handling**: 
   - If script provided: Pre-saves it and runs non-interactive
   - If no script: Runs interactive mode for script input
5. **🎬 Video Creation**: Calls shortscreator.py with proper parameters
6. **📊 Catalog**: Updates game catalog with processing history
7. **✨ Post-Processing**: Offers to open output folder and play video
