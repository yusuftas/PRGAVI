Satisfactory is a first-person, open-world factory-building game where you explore, automate, and conquer an alien planet. Play solo or in co-op as a FICSIT employee tasked with harvesting natural resources and building massive, multi-level factories. Automate everything-use conveyor belts, trains, trucks, and pipes to minimize manual labor and optimize production. Explore the 30kmï¿½ planet. Using vehicles, jetpacks, and jump pads. Discover rare materials, tame the wild terrain, and fend off local wildlife. With deep customization, you can build your dream factory in towering verticals or across sprawling plains. Whether you're a perfectionist or a chaotic creator, Satisfactory delivers industrial joy.
