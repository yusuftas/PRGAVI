With 40+ multiclass combos, evolving characters, and extensive visual customization, each playthrough feels unique. Relationships shift, injuries matter, and the story adapts to your choices through the game's Casting Director engine.Plan legwork, upgrade your safehouse, and mod your weapons to stay ahead.
