The chain isn't just for looks it wraps, pulls, and reacts with real physics. Go solo or team up with up to 4 players locally. Choose your challenge with Beginner, Normal, or lava-chasing madness. Climb fast, fall hard, and race the heat. Leaderboards track your best runs across all modes. Escape isn't easy but it's unforgettable.",
