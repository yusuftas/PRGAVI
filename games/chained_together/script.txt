Chained Together Start in the depths of hell, chained to your friends, with one goal climb out. Every jump demands teamwork as you scale wild, punishing worlds. The chain isn't just for looks it wraps, pulls, and reacts with real physics. Go solo or team up with up to 4 players locally. Choose your challenge with Beginner, Normal, or lava-chasing madness. Climb fast, fall hard, and race the heat. Leaderboards track your best runs across all modes. Escape isn't easy but it's unforgettable.
